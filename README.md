# iAlerta – Front-end

## Overview

This repository contains the front-end of iAlerta, a web application designed to detect AI-generated content in texts, images and files.

The front-end focuses on performance, strong typing and maintainability, providing a clear user experience and reliable communication with the back-end API.

The project is built with React + Vite + TypeScript, using TailwindCSS to deliver a clean, responsive, and scalable user interface, ready to integrate with multiple AI detection APIs.

## Techologies Used
- React — Main library for building the UI
- Vite — Fast and lightweight bundler
- TypeScript — Static typing for better safety and scalability
- TailwindCSS — Utility-first CSS framework
- React Router — Routing management

## Project Goal

- Detect content potentially generated by Artificial Intelligence
- Provide a simple, intuitive, and modern user interface
- Centralize multiple types of content analysis in one platform
- Enable easy integration with external AI detection APIs
- Serve as a scalable base for future features (dashboard, history, reports, etc.)

## Best Practices

- Component-based architecture
- Strong typing with TypeScript
- Clear separation between business logic and UI
- Error handling and loading states
- Consistent styling with Tailwind CSS
