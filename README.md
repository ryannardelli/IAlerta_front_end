# IAlerta - Front-end

IAlerta is a modern front-end application focused on detecting AI-generated content, allowing analysis of texts, images, PDFs, links, and other formats, with an emphasis on digital security, authenticity, and fraud prevention.

The project is built with React + Vite + TypeScript, using TailwindCSS to deliver a clean, responsive, and scalable user interface, ready to integrate with multiple AI detection APIs.

## Techologies Used
- React — Main library for building the UI
- Vite — Fast and lightweight bundler
- TypeScript — Static typing for better safety and scalability
- TailwindCSS — Utility-first CSS framework
- React Router — Routing management

## Project Goal

- Detect content potentially generated by Artificial Intelligence
- Provide a simple, intuitive, and modern user interface
- Centralize multiple types of content analysis in one platform
- Enable easy integration with external AI detection APIs
- Serve as a scalable base for future features (dashboard, history, reports, etc.)
